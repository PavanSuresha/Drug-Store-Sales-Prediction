# Drug-Store-Sales-Prediction
Rossmann is a European drug distributor which operates over 3,000 drug stores across seven European countries. Since a lot of drugs come with a short shelf life, that is, they do not have a long expiry date, it becomes imperative for Rossmann to accurately forecast sales at their individual stores. As expected, store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotional campaigns, competition, state holidays, seasonality, and locality.The company needs the forecast daily sales for the next six weeks.Since the company is just embarking on this project, the scope has been kept to nine key stores across Europe. The stores are key for the company keeping in mind the revenue and historical prestige associated with them. These stores are numbered - 1,3,8,9,13,25,29,31 and 46.
